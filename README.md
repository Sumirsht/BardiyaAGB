# BardiyaAGB

This project estimates Above Ground Biomass Density (AGBD) in Bardiya, Nepal using Landsat satellite imagery, vegetation indices, elevation data, and deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras). The model predicts biomass at 100m resolution and evaluates its accuracy using test data split from ground samples.

📌 Features Used
The model uses spectral and topographic predictors:
Landsat Bands: B1–B7
Vegetation Indices: EVI, NDMI, NBR, MNDWI, NDWI, NDBI, NDBaI
Topography: Elevation (SRTM or other DEM)
